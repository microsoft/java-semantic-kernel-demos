Dear Contoso Ltd,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the widgets that I recently purchased from your company. I purchased a
set of widgets on 2021-10-15 and was excited to receive them, but upon opening the package, I was extremely disappointed
with the quality of the product.

The widgets are of poor quality and do not function as advertised. They are faulty and do not work properly, which has
caused me a great deal of frustration and inconvenience. I have tried to use them several times, but they simply do not
work as they should.

I am requesting a full refund for the faulty widgets that I purchased. I have attached a copy of my receipt for your reference.

I would appreciate it if you could process my refund as soon as possible. I am willing to return the faulty widgets to
your company if necessary.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe
